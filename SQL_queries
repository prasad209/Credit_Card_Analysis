select * from credit_card_transcations

--1- write a query to print top 5 cities with highest spends and their percentage 
--contribution of total credit card spends 
with ct1 as
(select city,sum(amount) as total_spend from credit_card_transcations
group by city),
ct2 as (select sum(amount) as complete_spend from credit_card_transcations) 
select top 5 ct1.* , (total_spend/complete_spend)*100 as perc_share from ct1
inner join ct2 on 1=1
order by total_spend
--2- write a query to print highest spend month and amount spent 
--in that month for each card type
select * from credit_card_transcations

--3- write a query to print the transaction details(all columns from the table) 
--for each card type when it reaches a cumulative of 1000000 total spends(We should have 4 rows 
--in the o/p one for each card type)
select *, ROW_NUMBER() over(partition by card_type order by amount) as rn from credit_card_transcations
--4- write a query to find city which had lowest percentage spend for gold card type
select * from credit_card_transcations

 


--5- write a query to print 3 columns:  city, highest_expense_type , 
--lowest_expense_type (example format : Delhi , bills, Fuel)
select * from credit_card_transcations
---somehow my solution below  is not woking,both inner queries are good ,but the outer one has issues 
select city, (case when rn=max(rn) then exp_type end) as highest_expense_type,
(case when rn=min(rn) then exp_type end) as lowest_expense_type from(
select city,exp_type ,expenses,ROW_NUMBER() over(partition by city order by expenses ) as rn from
(select distinct city, exp_type,sum(amount) over(partition by city,exp_type ) as expenses from credit_card_transcations) a
